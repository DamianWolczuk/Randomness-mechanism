 Object-oriented vs structures version of "Guess the number" game

2 versions to compare the object-oriented vs. structured version of the "Guess the number" game

Object-oriented version of the game "Guess the number"
I used the random import library, which has the function random.randint (min, max)
In this case, I expanded the game with 2 possibilities:
- Easy game - i.e. as in structural (1-20)
- Difficult game - range 1-30
For this purpose, I have defined the self.high_num variable, which will depend on the player's game mode selection

Structured version of the game "Guess the number"
I used the random import library, which has the function random.randint (min, max)
